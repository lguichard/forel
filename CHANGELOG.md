[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added metadata conditions for matching files by download website and download app, backed by macOS where-from metadata.
- The Contents condition now matches text inside PDFs (including scanned PDFs via OCR), Word documents, Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx), PowerPoint presentations (.pptx), Apple iWork documents (Pages, Numbers, Keynote), OpenDocument files (.odt, .ods, .odp), RTF files, and images (via OCR), and the Dry Run shows which content was read.
- The Contents condition can also match other indexed formats (.xls, .ppt, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, OpenDocument, EPUB) through the macOS Spotlight index, for "contains" matching when the file has been indexed.

### Changed
- The rule editor now warns that all-level subfolder scans can slow execution in folders with many files.

### Fixed
- Dry Run and Run Now no longer scan nested folders when only current-folder rules are enabled.
- The main window now has a larger minimum size so rule controls stay visible when resized.

## [0.1.0-beta.3] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- Dry Run now shows detailed per-file rule previews, including matched
  conditions, planned actions, source/target paths, and statuses such as
  "would run", "would skip", and "blocked by conflict".
- Dry Run now detects destination conflicts for move, copy, rename, trash,
  and delete previews without modifying files.
- Action history now records skipped and failed actions, including the reason
  or error message when available.
- Run Now shows a loading state while it's working and a confirmation
  message with the result once it's done.

### Changed
- New installs now start at login by default, and start with watching
  paused until you've set up your folders and rules.
- The old Preview action is now presented as Dry Run in the UI.
- The Dry Run window is larger to make rule details easier to inspect.
- The menu bar panel has more top padding so its header is not cramped under
  the popover arrow.
- The History view now groups activity by batch and file, shows full
  original path -> result path flow, and displays explicit status badges.
- Size conditions now default to MB instead of bytes.
- Crisper, better-sized menu bar icon.

### Fixed
- Fixed the "Update available" banner text getting cut off in the menu bar
  panel.
- Dry Run now follows simulated rename paths when evaluating following rules,
  matching the real execution order more closely.
- Condition rows in the rule editor now align consistently to the left.

## [0.1.0-beta.2] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- Fixed rules getting stuck when chained after a rename.
- Fixed the update checker sometimes offering an older alpha release
- Hardened folder-watching against a rare internal timing issue (no
  user-visible change).
- Rules with an invalid regex condition now show an error right in the
  editor and can't be saved, instead of silently never matching any file.
- Fixed the update checker occasionally announcing an update that wasn't
  actually downloadable yet, right after a new version was tagged.

## [0.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-06-17

The app has been rewritten from scratch in Swift, replacing the previous
Tauri + React + Rust stack (archived under `tauri/`). This isn't a port for
its own sake: a native SwiftUI/AppKit app gives Forel direct, low-level
control over the things that matter most for a file-automation tool —
FSEvents watching, the menu bar, window/login-item behavior, native macOS
look and feel — without a JS runtime or webview in the loop. It's a better
foundation for where the project is going: a simple, fast, and efficient
macOS-native experience, aimed at being a credible alternative to Hazel.

### Added
- Full native rewrite: SwiftUI/AppKit app shell (`ForelApp`) over a Swift
  core package (`ForelCore`) with its own rule engine, SQLite persistence,
  and FSEvents-based folder watcher.
- Menu bar quick panel: watching toggle, per-folder enable switches, and an
  activity summary, without opening the main window.
- Settings: appearance (theme, accent color), start at login, and update
  preferences, backed by the same SQLite `app_settings` table as the rest
  of the app's state.
- Self-updater: checks GitHub Releases for newer tags (every 12h, plus a
  manual "Check Now"), shows a prominent in-app banner and a menu bar badge
  when an update is available, and installs it in place — no Sparkle
  dependency, no appcast required.
- Action history with undo/redo per entry and per batch.

### Changed
- Continues the existing `0.1.0.x` line started by the Tauri-era alphas
  below — this beta is the same product, rebuilt on a native stack, not a
  fresh project.

### Removed
- The Tauri/React frontend and Rust backend are no longer the active app;
  the source is kept under `tauri/` for reference only.
- Sparkle dependency (was already disabled in dev builds; replaced by the
  GitHub Releases-based updater above).

## [0.1.0-alpha.3] - 2026-06-15
- Update checks run on app launch and every 4 hours.
- Persisted app settings, including paused/watching state.

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-06-15

  dynamically instead of a hardcoded string.

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-06-15

  label, custom tags), preview before running rules, tray icon with status
  indicator, CI and release workflows.
