## Why Forel

Forel is a free, open-source, community-driven take on folder automation for macOS. Define rules once — watch folders, match files, and move, rename, tag, or label them automatically — then let Forel run quietly in your menu bar.

---

## What Forel does

Forel watches your folders and organizes your files automatically based on rules you define — by filename, extension, kind, size, date, tags, or color label.

```

Set up a rule once. Forel handles the rest — even when the window is closed.

And everything happens **on your Mac**. No cloud. No API keys. No subscription. Your files never leave your machine.

---

## Highlights

- **Free & open source** — no license fee, no subscription, MIT-licensed.
- **100% on-device** — no cloud, no API keys, no account. Your files never leave your Mac.
- **Rule-based** — match by name, extension, kind, size, date, tags, or color label.
- **Native menu-bar app** — runs quietly in the background; toggle rules without opening the window.
- **Community-driven** — built in the open, contributions welcome.

---

## Features

- **Rule-based automation** — Create flexible rules combining filename patterns, file types, sizes, dates, tags, and Finder color labels.
- **Folder watching** — Monitor any number of folders in real time with native macOS FSEvents.
- **Menu bar app** — Forel lives in your menu bar. Toggle individual rules on/off without opening the main window.
- **Actions** — Move, copy, rename, tag, trash, delete, or run a custom script.
- **SQLite persistence** — Rules, folders, and history are stored locally in a bundled SQLite database.

## Installation

### Manual

Download the latest release `.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/forel-app/forel/releases) page, open it, and drag Forel to your Applications folder.

### Build from source

**Prerequisites:** [Swift 6](https://www.swift.org) · macOS 14 or later

```bash
git clone https://github.com/forel-app/forel.git
cd forel
swift build
swift test
swift run ForelApp
```

To build and package the app, use the Swift package tooling and the existing release workflow.

> Requires macOS 14 Sonoma or later.

---

## Quick Start

1. Launch Forel — the icon appears in your **menu bar**.
2. Click the icon to see active rules, or open the main window.
3. Click **New Rule** and choose a folder to watch.
4. Define your conditions — by name, extension, kind, size, date, tags, or color label.
5. Set an action: move, rename, tag, copy, or run a script.
6. Enable the rule. Forel handles the rest — even when the window is closed.

---

## Architecture

Forel is built as a native Swift macOS app:

```
forel/
├── Package.swift              # Swift Package Manager manifest
├── Sources/
│   ├── ForelApp/              # SwiftUI app, menu bar, settings, editor, views
│   └── ForelCore/             # Rule engine, watcher, SQLite persistence, models
├── Tests/
│   └── ForelCoreTests/        # Core engine and persistence tests
```

**Key technology choices:**

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| App shell | SwiftUI + AppKit | Native macOS UI with direct control over windows, menu bar, and focus |
| Backend | Swift 6 | Unified app and core logic, strong typing, simple packaging |
| File watching | Native FSEvents wrapper | Low-latency, battery-friendly folder monitoring |
| Database | SQLite | Embedded, no server, predictable schema and queries |
| Persistence layer | Custom Swift database wrapper | Direct control over transactions, migrations, and rule round-trips |
| Updates | GitHub Releases check | Detects new tagged releases; ad-hoc signed builds are updated by manual reinstall, not in-place patching |
| Build | Swift Package Manager | Single toolchain for development, test, and release |
